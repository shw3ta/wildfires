# Forest fires model 3 ​

This repository contains cellular automata simulation of forest fires based on [Malamud et. al, 1998](https://github.com/shw3ta/wildfires/blob/main/references/MalamudTurcotteMorein_ForestFires_Science_1998.pdf) made for the purpose of [Introduction to Python](https://github.com/eulerlab/pyclass23) course at University of Tübingen in an academic year 2022/23 by Shweta Prasad and Weronika Sójka. 

The program is able to run in two different modes: 
- slow mode featuring an animation of the model, 
- fast mode without animation which verifies the principal statement in the paper. 

All scripts can be found in [wildfires/scripts](https://github.com/shw3ta/wildfires/tree/main/scripts). There is associated webapp in which you can find a user-friendly application: click here.
